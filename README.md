# Directional / Spatial Stroop (Spatial Attention) Game

A *Python game* built using *Pygame* to simulate the *Directional / Spatial Stroop Effect*, designed to study cognitive interference and spatial attention.  

Players respond to the *word displayed* (LEFT or RIGHT) while ignoring a *distractor arrow, which may point in the same or opposite direction. The game tracks **accuracy* and *reaction time*, making it suitable for educational demonstrations, cognitive training, or psychology experiments.
